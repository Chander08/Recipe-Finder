#steps I guess?

'''
1st we're gonna need to get recipes from some recipe site as well as have the information about all the ingredients
need to find a website like that which has the api (the connecting part to access data from)

Then we can have something which takes the ingredients as user input and looks in the data to see all recipes which match all
requirements. 


then, once we have that data we create a website? Might need html/javascript/css/ for that though.
